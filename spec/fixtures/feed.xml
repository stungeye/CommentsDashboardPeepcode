        <description><![CDATA[In 1945 I lived near Nunspeet and I can still remember the Canadians coming into our area with their tanks I will be eternally grateful to the Canadians who were part of the liberation of Holland although at the time I was a little mad at them because they wouldn&#039;t allow me to join the other kids for a tank ride because I was too young]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[I read all of your posts, but particularly appreciated this one.  

I&#039;m a Canadian because both of my parents immigrated to Canada from the Netherlands (North Holland and Frylan, to be precise) after WWII.  

The Dutch gratitude for Canada&#039;s significant contributions are shown in other ways as well.  The tulips on Parliament Hill in Canada were a gift from The Netherlands and the Royal Family sends another 10,000 every year.  The Netherlands Centennial Carillon in Victoria, BC was a gift from the Dutch community of British Columbia in thanks for Canada&#039;s role in liberating The Netherlands.  There are other examples.

As Canadians, we are grateful the recognition our country continues to receive from The Netherlands - sometimes moreso than in Canada.  When I&#039;ve been in The Netherlands, the fact that I&#039;m Canadian has always been a significant advantage.  

To celebrate the day, I&#039;m going to cycle home in my orange jersey, slick my hair back with gel, have some drop,stroopwaffel and pickled herring, and think of something particularly blunt to say to my British in-laws.  Gezellig!

I love your site.  Please don&#039;t stop writing.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Ok, I GET this special relationship between the Canadians and Dutch. But we should also step back and look at the bigger picture.  Britain, United States, Australia, New Zealand (and probably other Allied countries) and (hello!) the USSR were all totally consumed with liberating Europe and Asia.  The Netherlands was just one sub-theatre and so many souls were sacrificed to bring it all to an end.  The Canadians didn&#039;t choose Netherlands to liberate because they especially liked us.  It was a part of a larger strategy and somewhat arbitrary as to who went where.  It could just as easily have been Americans or Brits that were the majority of the liberation of NL if Ike and Monty had had a slightly different idea.   The millions of Russians who died were just as instrumental in liberating Holland through their attrition of Hitler&#039;s Wehrmacht on the Steppes.  We should remember ALL of the liberators on May 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.  And then again on August 15.  And could the world please think at least twice before throwing more souls into the fire?]]></description>

In the following year, the royal family contributed thousands as well, and a further ten thousand yearly since.
